Contributing ideas and change proposals
=======================================

We are always looking for suggestions about how to improve the engine. User feedback
is the main driving force behind our decision-making process, and limitations that
you might face while working on your project are a great data point for us when considering
engine enhancements.

If you experience a usability problem or are missing a feature in the current version of
Godot, start by discussing it with our `community <https://godotengine.org/community/>`_.
There may be other, perhaps better, ways to achieve the desired result that community members
could suggest. And you can learn if other users experience the same issue, and figure out
a good solution together.

If you come up with a well-defined idea for the engine, feel free to open a
`proposal issue <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues>`_.
Try to be specific and concrete while describing your problem and your proposed
solution â€” only actionable proposals can be considered. It is not required, but
if you want to implement it yourself, that's always appreciated!

If you only have a general idea without specific details, you can open a
`proposal discussion <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/discussions>`_.
These can be anything you want, and allow for a free-form discussion in search of
a solution. Once you find one, a proposal issue can be opened.

Please, read the `readme <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/blob/master/README.md>`_
document before creating a proposal to learn more about the process.
