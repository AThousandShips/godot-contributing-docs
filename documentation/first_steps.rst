Getting started
===============

There are two separate resources referred to as "documentation" in Godot:

- **The class reference.** This is the documentation for the complete Godot API
  as exposed to GDScript and the other scripting languages. It can be consulted
  offline, directly in Godot's code editor, or online at Godot :ref:`Class Reference
  <doc_class_reference>`. To contribute to the class reference, you have to edit the
  XML file corresponding to the class and make a pull request.
  See :ref:`doc_updating_the_class_reference` and :ref:`doc_class_reference_primer`
  for more details.

- **The tutorials and engine documentation and its translations.**
  This is the part you are reading now, which is distributed in the HTML format.
  Its contents are generated from plain text files in the reStructured Text
  (rst) format, to which you can contribute via pull requests on the
  `godot-docs <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_ GitHub repository.
  See :ref:`doc_contributing_to_the_documentation` for more details.
