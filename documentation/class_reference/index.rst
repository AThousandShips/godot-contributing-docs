Contributing to the class reference
===================================

The pages below focus on the class reference.

As the reference is included in the Godot editor, its source files are part of
the `godot repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`_. We use XML files
to write it, so the process to contribute to the class reference differs from
writing the online manual.
