Documentation overview
======================

We always need help to improve the documentation, be it the class reference or
the manual. Below, you can find our content and writing guidelines and
concrete guides to make changes to the documentation.

Be sure to also check the :ref:`workflow guidelines <doc_contributing_to_the_documentation>`,
especially if you're new to using Git or GitHub.

There are two separate resources referred to as "documentation" in Godot:

- **The class reference.** This is the documentation for the complete Godot API
  as exposed to GDScript and the other scripting languages. It can be consulted
  offline, directly in Godot's code editor, or online at Godot `Class Reference
  <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/index.html>`__.
  To contribute to the class reference, you have to edit the XML file
  corresponding to the class and make a pull request.
  See :ref:`doc_updating_the_class_reference` and `Class reference primer <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/engine_details/class_reference/index.html>`__
  for more details.

- **The tutorials and engine documentation and its translations.**
  This is the part you can `find online <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/>`_.
  Its contents are generated from plain text files in the reStructured Text
  (rst) format, to which you can contribute via pull requests on the
  `godot-docs <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_ GitHub repository.
  See :ref:`doc_contributing_to_the_documentation` for more details.
