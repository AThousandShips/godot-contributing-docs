Team triage trackers
--------------------

To search for PRs with requested reviews from a team, add
``team-review-requested:`` to the search bar, followed by the team name
(see below for each team, the link opens a search on GitHub). Note that
this *doesn’t* show PRs that have already been reviewed by that team,
any review comments at all, from any member of a specific team, will
remove the request, so this is not always helpful.

You can find the various areas and their respective trackers on the page
:ref:`doc_areas`. For more information about the different GitHub labels, please see the
:ref:`doc_bug_triage_guidelines`. Note that some GitHub labels aren’t neatly covered by trackers.
