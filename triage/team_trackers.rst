Team triage trackers
--------------------

.. raw:: html



To search for PRs with requested reviews from a team, add
``team-review-requested:`` to the search bar, followed by the team name
(see below for each team, the link opens a search on GitHub). Note that
this *doesn’t* show PRs that have already been reviewed by that team,
any review comments at all, from any member of a specific team, will
remove the request, so this is not always helpful.

Some GitHub labels aren’t neatly covered by trackers, below is a list of
teams and labels that don’t (currently) have trackers: \* 2D Nodes: -
`godotengine/2d-nodes `__
- ``topic:2d``
`issues `__
`PRs `__
\* 3D Nodes: -
`godotengine/3d-nodes `__
- ``topic:3d``
`issues `__
`PRs `__
\* Documentation: -
`godotengine/documentation `__
- ``documentation``
`issues `__
`PRs `__
\* Tests: -
`godotengine/tests `__
- ``topic:tests``
`issues `__
`PRs `__

For more information about the different GitHub labels, please see the
